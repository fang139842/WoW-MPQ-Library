# WoW-MPQ-Library

# MPQToolDev (Experimental)

**MPQToolDev** is an open-source experimental project for managing MPQ files in the World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King client. 

## Project Overview
This project consists of two main components:
- **MPQDumper**: A DLL library aiming to extract file paths from MPQ archives.
- **MPQInjector**: A utility for injecting the DLL into `wow.exe`.

âš  **Current Status**:  
The project is in an early stage of development and is **not yet fully functional**. The extraction of MPQ paths is incomplete, and significant debugging and refinement are required.

## Goals
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Correctly extract file paths from MPQ files.
- Provide tools for cleaning and managing MPQ file lists.

## How to Contribute
We are actively seeking contributors to help:
- Debug and fix issues with MPQ path extraction.
- Improve the injection process for better stability.
- Expand the documentation for easier usage.

Feel free to open issues, fork the repository, and submit pull requests!
